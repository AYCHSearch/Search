# Configuration README

This directory contains configuration files to support fulltext indexing.  The intention in the first instance is to replicate The European Library (TEL) functionality as closely as possible.

On initial import, only two significant changes have been made to the `schema.xml` document.

1. Language codes have been normalised to ISO 630-1 standard (two-letter codes)
1. The now-deprecated `enablePositionIncrements` attribute has been removed
