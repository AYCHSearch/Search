# TODOs

## Immediate

* check out facet behaviour when clause removed

## Longer term

* remove facet constraints if OR operator
* save and retrieve query
* edit serialised query (and update other controls)
* facetable fields in config file
* disguise root group's existence for user-friendliness
* split JS file into multiple files

### Refactoring

* it's clear we need a 'preflight' mode for queries rather than handling
'undo' operations piecemeal
