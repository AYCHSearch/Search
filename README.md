# Europeana: catalyst for change in the world of cultural heritage

## What does it do?

Europeana is an internet portal that acts as an interface to millions of books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised throughout Europe. This repository contains our search tools, search algorithms, search plugins, and everything search related to assist in finding _that_ particular record amidst the millions.
